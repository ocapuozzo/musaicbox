# musaicbox

Application JS is a demonstration implement of [88 Musaics](https://sites.google.com/view/88musaics) concepts.
Illustrates how geometry can highlight relationships between PCS. 

- Bidirectional UI interaction: in clock and matrix representations

- Geometrical transformations 2D/3D of Musaic/PCS

- Simple music notation representation with [https://abcjs.net/](https://abcjs.net/) 
 
- Some PCS features of Musical Set Theory presented  

- Group Theory : Group builder & Group action UI (trivial, dihedral, affine, ...) 
   
May be use as 

- Compositional tool
- Application example of Group Theory (Zx Affine Group). Develop with group theory concepts and implemented by permutation operations (inside a vector).
 

Note : produces no sound !
